Hands in your pockets, ooh, such a sexy stance
You look me up and down with your burning glance
I bet you didn't come here just to dance
Baby, you know I got your number
I can read you like a book
And I'll bet my bottom dollar
You love even better than you look

(Prove me right, prove me right)
Prove me right
Bet there's nothing you can do
I wouldn't like
(Prove me right, prove me right)
Bet you're even better in the dark that in the light
Come on, prove me right!

Bet you're the kind who knows just what to do
I bet you could make me wanna do it too
(We will, before the night is through)
Put your loving arms around me
Keep them going nice and strong
'Cause I know here is where you belong
If two wishes that for long (?)

(Prove me right, prove me right)
Prove me right
There's nothing you can do
I wouldn't like
(Prove me right, prove me right)
Bet you're even better in the dark that in the light
Come on, prove me right!

Let's not waste any time on foolish lies, whoa
I thought that I'm the one you got in mind
Prove me right

Don't you know I got your number
I can read you like a book
And I'll bet my bottom dollar
You love even better than you look
Hey, hey, hey...

(Prove me right, prove me right)
Prove me right
There's nothing you can do
I wouldn't like
(Prove me right, prove me right)
Bet you're even better in the dark that in the light
Come on, prove me right!

(Prove me right, prove me right)
Prove me right, who-ah...
(Prove me right, prove me right)
Let's not waste any time
Bet you're even better than in the night
Whoo...
(Prove me right, prove me right)
Don't you know the one you got in mind?
(Prove me right, prove me right)
Come on, prove me right!
Bet you're even better than...
(Prove me right, prove me right)
Yeah, let's not waste any time
(Prove me right, prove me right)
