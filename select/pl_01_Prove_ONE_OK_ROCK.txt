ONE STEP AT A TIME
NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES
I WILL MAKE THE CLIMB
LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES I'VE MADE
WHEN TIMES ARE LOOKING TOUCH
I WILL BE LOOKING UP TO YOU
I FOUND A BETTER LIFE
THAT'LL BE THE ONE THAT I CHOOSE
I NEED ANSWERS
NOBODY EVER
NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW
STICKS AND STONES WILL NEVER
BREAK THESE BONES
ONE STEP AT A TIME
NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES
I WILL MAKE THE CLIMB
LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES I'VE MADE
AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE
IT TO YOU
PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE WITHOUT A
DOURT
GIVE ME THE ONE CHANCE THE ONE CHANCE
SO I CAN SO I CAN PROVE TO YOU
心を開いて
見出す新しい世界を
連れてく 必ず
行き止まりはない もう
ああ言えばこう言う
どうしようもない
答えはない時代に
君は何を思う?
STICKS AND STONES WILL NEVER
BREAK THESE BONES
ONE STEP AT A TIME
NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES
I WILL MAKE THE CLIMB
LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES I'VE MADE
AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE
IT TO YOU
PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE WITHOUT A
DOUBT
GIVE ME THE ONE CHANCE THE ONE CHANCE
SO I CAN SO I CAN PROVE TO YOU
I MIGHT BEND BUT I'M NOT GONNA BREAK NO MORE
MIGHT BE TIRED BUT I'M NOT BOUT TO GIVE UP NO
I MIGHT BEND BUT I'M NOT GONNA BREAK NO MORE
NO STICKS AND NO STONES
AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE

PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE IT TO YOU PROVE WITHOUT A
DOUBT
