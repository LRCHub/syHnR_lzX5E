It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
I got my mind made up and my high heels on
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong

You said if you left
I'd be laid up in a bed of tears
I'd be going crazy 'cause without you baby
I'd be sad and lonely 'round here

It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
I got my mind made up, got my high heels on
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong, no
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong

I know you've told our friends
I won't find another man like you
But no one's gonna hold me, no one's gonna love me
Nothin' like the way you do

It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
I got my mind made up and my high heels on
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong, no
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong

You've been too busy talking
To even see me walking

It wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much
It wouldn't take much, yeah
It wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much
It wouldn't take much

It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong
I got my mind made up and my high heels on
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong, no
It wouldn't take much to prove you wrong

It wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much
It wouldn't take much, yeah
Oh no, it wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much
It wouldn't take much
And I will prove you wrong, baby
(It wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much)
(It wouldn't take much, yeah)
I got my high heels on, baby
(It wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much)
And I will prove you wrong
(It wouldn't take much)
I got my high heels on now, baby
(It wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much)
(It wouldn't take much)
No no, it wouldn't take much
(It wouldn't take much, it wouldn't take much)
(It wouldn't take much)
No no no
