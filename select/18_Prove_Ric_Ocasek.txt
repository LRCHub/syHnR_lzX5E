You show me all your photographs
You could leave me hanging
High
You could show me all the mystery
Hiding in your eyes
You could give a thousand reasons
Why i should be with you
But i'll just be in season
Just like you want me to
You don't have to prove a thing
Pretty girl pretty girl
You don't have to prove a thing
Oh pretty girl pretty girl
You could tell me all your secrets
That i would only keep 'em
You can have your soup du jour
When you're fast asleep
Well
When you turn me over
Keep it all in time
Put on your precious makeup
You won't stand in line
You don't have to prove a thing
Little girl pretty girl
You don't have to prove a thing
Pretty girl
I'm standing in your doorway
Don't you try to lock it
I might just try to walk away
With something in my pocket
Anything you want to do
It easily gets done
Even on a rainy day
You could pull the sun
You don't have to prove a thing
Pretty girl pretty girl
You don't have to prove a thing
Pretty girl pretty girl
You don't have to prove a thing
You don't have to prove a thing
