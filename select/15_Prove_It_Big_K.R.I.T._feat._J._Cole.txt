If you believe in me, prove it
When the time come, and the time will come
When I pass the choppa, shoot (Shoot)
Yeah, yeah
If you believe in me, prove it
If the time come, and the time will come
When I pass the choppa, shoot
(That time, get ready, maintain, hold on
That time, get ready, maintain, hold on)

Believe in me, believe in me
Read for me, grieve for me
If I'm gone, and carry on on your own
You're way stronger than you think
Ain't no safety if it ain't safe
Headshot or the bass, cut the head of the snake
In the grass of your yard, they tryna pull your card
Show your hand, keep it clean, they gon' jam, understand
I know, I know you wanna be the bigger person
If all they want to do is hurt you, show 'em how the trigger workin'

If you believe in me, prove it
When the time come, and the time will come
When I pass the choppa, shoot (Shoot)
Yeah, yeah
If you believe in me, prove it
If the time come, and the time will come
When I pass the choppa, shoot
(That time, get ready, maintain, hold on
That time, get ready, maintain, hold on)

Post quarters across the borders of life
Now these ain't orders in case you don't get 'em right
I seen what happen to us when the havin' a lots
Have had enough of the fact that you
Been did more with the scraps that was given
And they hate to see you pass them up
Tax invasion, watch the cages, think we apes or we animals
They can't pick, they turn violence, spray the TEC
Ghrdufuyghydol
That was yours in the sand
It's the realest, let me tell it
Once I'm sure it won't jam

If you believe in me, prove it
When the time come, and the time will come
When I pass the choppa, shoot (Shoot)
Yeah, yeah
If you believe in me, prove it (Prove it)
If the time come, and the time will come
When I pass the choppa, shoot (When I pass the choppa, shoot, yeah)
(That time, get ready, maintain, hold on
That time, get ready, maintain, hold on)

Big K.R.I.T., my nigga, I feel your shit
Been feelin' your shit since Felton put me on
I put him on Dot, he put me on K.R.I.T
Was here since then, now here's half-gone
I wrote more songs than a man can count
Tryna figure out how to put 'em out
Without waterin' down my brand
I don't want 'em to not want my jams
Don't wanna become something that nobody wanna hear
But I recognize this as a bitch-ass fear
Why the fuck do I care if I ain't got your ear?
Then I ain't revered, if I ain't revered then why am I here?
What if these songs you refuse to share
All due to the fact that you insecure
Coulda helped somebody out there like you
See the world more clear, let me switch gear
Allow me to use this feature

To shoutout one of the first fans that a nigga ever had named Felicia
I was brand new to the game, wasn't used to no fame
So it was unusual I would land in a city and see you at baggage claim
Come to find out you was workin' for Delta
So you got to fly for the free and that means
That I was seein' you like every show
At first it felt weird but you was just so
Casual 'bout it and not some over-the-top fan
And that was just lettin' me know
"I really fuck with you Cole"
Today I saw you post some terrible news as I scroll so
This one is for you, want you to pull through
I better see you on the road

If you believe in me, prove it
